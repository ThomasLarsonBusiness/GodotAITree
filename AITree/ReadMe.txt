Welcome to the AI Tree Plugin!

This is a plugin for the Godot Engine that enables developers to create AI behavior trees either in code or through a visual editor. If you want to view what the plugin looks in the Godot Engine, make sure you are using Godot 4.2 and simple add the contents of this zip folder to addons/AITree, simply creating the folders if they do not exist. Once the folder is added, either reboot the project or go to Project/Project Settings in the task bar, go the plugins panel, then ensure the checkbox next to the AI Tree plugin is checked. You should see an AI Tree tab in the top middle of the editor. If the box in the plugins window is checked and the AI Tree tab is not visible, then uncheck the box and check it again.

There is also a V1 Documentation pdf in this folder. This folder should contain an overview of the different elements of the project, including how the tree should work in code and how the visual editor should work. Much like the plugin the documentation is in early development and may be out of date or have grammatical or content errors. That said, the documentation should walk you through the basic principals of creating a tree and the graph.
